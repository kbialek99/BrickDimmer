This project was made to make the leds from the CADA brick sets smart, using ESP32 and the light sensor.

This project can be built and uploaded to esp device as a standalone program that will check the light intensity, and based on that will turn on/off the LEDs.

Alternatively BrickDimmer.yaml can be uploaded via ESPHome, making it compatibile with the HomeAssistant. 2 entities will be added, the switch button and the light sensor.
